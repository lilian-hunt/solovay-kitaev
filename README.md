# Solovay Kitaev Algorithm
An implementation of the Solovay Kitaev quantum gate decomposition algorithm. This is derived from the description in Dawson C.M., Nielsen M.A., The Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, arXiv:quant-ph/0505030v2. [DN05]. 

This currently only implements the gc-decompose function for single qubit gates.
